 * does at the bottom.  To make up for this, we make the volume scale look
 * sort of logarithmic (actually an upside-down inverse square curve) so
 * that the volume value passed to the drive changes less and less as you
 * approach the maximum slider setting.  Additionally, only the top half
 * of the volume scale is valid; the bottom half is all silent.  The actual
 * formula looks like
 *
 *     max^2 - (max - vol)^2   max
 * v = --------------------- + ---
