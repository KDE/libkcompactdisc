This directory contains the WorkMan library.

libworkman is a multi-plaform CD-Player library for creating various
CD-Player-UIs.

  I have reworked most part of libworkman, get rid of most of externals
  add cdda support for linux and, I hope not breaked it for SUN ;-)

  Interface was cleaned, that means for a potentialy application developers
  new rules:
    1. please include only wm_cdrom.h. It has all defines and functions, what
       you need. You have any exceptions.
    2. for cdtext, include wm_cdtext.h also.
    3. for cddb, include wm_cddb.h (think, it's not so powerfull and can be replaced with
       some new external library.
    4. wm_cdinfo declares some externals now, I will change it in the future.
